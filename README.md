## Ideation for v2

- **Blog:** finally starting that blog. It could start with a profile of the people I've been talking to (themes could include my journey, exploring data journalism, exploring tech policy, exploring computer science, undergrad venturing).
- **Site structure:** If I want a blog, then the site can't be a SPA anymore.
- **Homepage layout:** why force people to hover over text before they can see your projects? Have them laid out in a grid, save the current `SelectedProjects` feature for open source or more minor things. (Or maybe just have them all out, like that NPR blog post or Sarah-something from 538.
- **Banner/snackbar on top:** available for freelance hire
